## What Needs My Attention?

This is a simple script that takes a keyword (usually a langugage) as an
argument and processes through GitHub's repositories finding the most
starred projects with the most open issues (it loosely uses popularity
to organize them). 

## Motivations For Using This Repo

I have wanted to contribute to an open source project on many occasions
but have been unsure about where to go to contribute. This was a simple
idea to immediately know what repos have the most need (by one far from
perfect metric) based on the languages you know. 

To get started just enter this command replacing "language" with your
language of choice:

`sh where_to_contribute.sh langauge`
